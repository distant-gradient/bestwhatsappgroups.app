Before we check out the whatsapp group names for family or friends group names, it is important to understand the reason why Whatsapp app has gained so much popularity and has kept billions of people engaged on the app. Let's deep dive into this topic.

## Why is Whatsapp app so popular?

There are plenty of family whatsapp groups, friends whatsapp groups, club buddies whatsapp groups, cousin whatsapp groups and so on. Each of these helps a very large number of people to keep chatting over whatsapp, catch up with one another after a long time. Chatting over whatsapp has facilitated such speedy communication that apart from socializing, people are instantly able to connect with one another professionally and sometimes share very relevant, useful and important information which may be required for the purposes of spreading immediate awareness amongst people. Staying online on whatsapp seems crucial, now more than ever, because its the simplest way to stay in touch with loved ones, which tends to lighten up a persons day. One may find many people on whatsapp online all day until late night.It has become such an addictive pleasure that no one can live without. What is interesting to note here is that people share a lot of funny jokes, videos and prank related web content on whatsapp. Whatsapp group names can sometimes really change the whole mood and feel of a conversation. In many people’s experience creating whatsapp groups and giving whatsapp group names for an upcoming special event, such as a family member's wedding, can spread even more joy and help the group to stay alive for many years even after the special event is complete. This happens because memories keep playing in people’s minds and many close family members who live in different parts of the world and aren’t able to meet up physically very often can stay connected on whatsapp online forever. Photos and videos of special experiences keep reminding people of all the comic and fun related incidents which made their moods so lively and make them feel as though it’s happening all over again right now. Another use of such whatsapp groups is that, especially in the case of weddings , there are always dance practices involved. So a lot of people who aren’t able to attend the practices on the early onset are able to see the steps for their dance performances on whatsapp online to know everything in advance and prepare accordingly.Needless to say the funny jokes regarding husband and wife quarrels storm every shaadi whatsapp group before and after the wedding day. Another very popular whatsapp groups category is that of cousins. For many of us in India, the cousins bond sometimes outweighs that of siblings. Cousins who do not get the chance to meet frequently can now stay in touch and share beautiful memories with one another through pictures and conversations on whatsapp online. These groups also help in planning out trips and vacations where cousins can gather and enjoy the delight of being one another’s company. Cousins discuss things freely on such whatsapp groups and give funky or even abusive or objectionable whatsapp group names, which seem unlikely in a family whatsapp group. Close friends and relatives or even colleagues can plan outings on their respective whatsapp groups. Some can even discuss major things about the problems in their workplace to relieve themselves of stress as they won’t be able to do the same in office in front of their bosses. So these are the various things which can create a sensation within whatsapp groups. 

Now that we've understood the different reasons why people use whatsapp groups. Let us look at some of the cool and creative whatsapp group names that can be used to share a laugh over or to keep it memorable.
