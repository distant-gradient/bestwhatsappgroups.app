## Who benefits from these groups?

These links are useful for sellers or resellers of products who wish to increase sales online. Whatsapp groups offer one of the best ways to market your products to the relevant target audience. There are several people out there willing to buy products from sellers on whatsapp groups. That’s why whatsapp groups act as a superb platform to market your product free of cost and at a huge scale. All it needs is for you to seek out appropriate whatsapp group invite link, join them and begin posting deals and offers to the right target audience. An advice to sellers is to post about their products by staying on context. For example, in shopping deals whatsapp group links, sellers should post their products with discounts and offers. This will help you stay on context with the purpose of the group and will help increase sales conversions. If the audience in the group is seeking discounted products, and you as a seller post products at full-price, then chances of conversion tend to remain low and you may also end up losing the audience as people start leaving groups. Another option for sellers can be to list their products on Paytm, Amazon or Flipkart and join the respective loot deals whatsapp groups to post links to their existing listings. A combination of both options can greatly benefit the seller.
