This will help you stay on context with the purpose of the group and will help increase sales conversions. If the audience in the group is seeking discounted products, and you as a seller post products at full-price, then chances of conversion tend to remain low and you may also end up losing the audience as people start leaving groups. Another option for sellers can be to list their products on Paytm, Amazon or Flipkart and join the respective loot deals whatsapp groups to post links to their existing listings. A combination of both options can greatly benefit the seller.
