You have probably already heard about and used WhatsApp. It is by far the best app for chatting or calling. Every friend, family member or even office colleagues have their personal groups on Whatsapp so that they can talk, share and stay in touch. In fact, if you run a small business, you can use the Whatsapp Business app to conduct all your customer interactions through whatsapp. Finding potential customers also has never been easier on the Whatsapp Business app. We'll tell you how.  

Did you know that there unlimited WhatsApp groups that are created for sharing different types of interesting content like job alerts, memes, jokes, cricket alerts, and so on. Millions of people join such groups every day to get latest updates, make new friends who have similar interests or simply to stay busy with exciting new content through the day. This provides a great opportunity, especially for Indians, since there are tons of Indian whatsapp group links out there to help connect all of us depending on our shared interests.

But finding such whatsapp groups to join is not easy. You have to find such the whatsapp group links by asking your friends to invite you or by extensively searching through scattered online sources. And sometimes, once you find the invite to whatsapp group links, it is either full or inactive or the invite link has stopped working. So we decided to solve this problem by creating a huge public collection of active indian whatsapp group links, for various topics and languages, that are updated every day. Isn't that great?

Another thing is that in order to join groups, users earlier had to ask the admin to add them to the group. This was difficult to do. But now, whatsapp has made it very easy to join all types of groups by launching the "WhatsApp Group Invite Link" feature.

The "WhatsApp Groups - Invite Link" feature is very convenient for all whatsapp users. In order to join any group, you can simply click on the group invite link without needing any permission from any admin. The feature is that simple to use.


## How to join WhatsApp Groups?

As I mentioned above, joining groups via the "WhatsApp Group Invite Links" is very easy and simple. Just follow the steps below -

- First, scroll down and choose your favorite new whatsapp group link.
- Then, simply click on the whatsapp group join link. It will open the whatsapp group in a new browser window.
- Choose "WhatsApp" from the list of apps to open. A pop-up will open with the group details like picture and name. 
- Finally, join the group by clicking on the green "Join Group" button. 


## WhatsApp Group Rules

When you join whatsapp groups, it is important to be a good member of the group. Most of the members of whatsapp groups are respectful and actively share content (like articles i.e. message for whatsapp and video for whatsapp) which are related to the group topic. Remember to follow the below rules.

- No Spamming
- Respect everyone
- No Fighting
- No bad words or abuse
- Do not change group makeover
- No Adult content (18+)
