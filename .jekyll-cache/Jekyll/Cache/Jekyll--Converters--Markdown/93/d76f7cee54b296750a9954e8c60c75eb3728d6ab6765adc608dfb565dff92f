<p>We want to provide whatsapp group links relevant to corona virus, so that you can all receive credible updates about the number of coronavirus cases, and take the necessary precautionary steps towards avoiding catching the virus and helping slow down the spread of it within India. It is essential, for all of us Indians, to be mindful of our actions and act like responsible citizens. Widespread cases in India can lead to a mass panic situation and can put a lot of stress of our already weak healthcare institutions. Existing healthcare institutions will not be able to accommodate our population. Therefore, it is even more important for common man in India to be responsible and take the right measures. Let us take a look at what all we can do in our own capacity.</p>
