I"&<p>There are now Whatsapp stickers available on the latest version update of whatsapp. It’s an exciting feature because it helps users communicate better using visual-aid rather than plain old text. Whatsapp sticker designs are also far more impactful than emojis and we also have the option of creating personal whatsapp stickers, especially for the favourite festivals such as diwali sticker, new years stickers for whatsapp, christmas stickers for whatsapp etc. Funny whatsapp stickers are the next best thing to memes, and have therefore gained significant popularity. Other popular categories are happy birthday sticker, malayalam stickers, emoji stickers such as good morning stickers, bollywood stickers and many more. Some of you are even interested in receiving tamil bad words stickers or adult whatsapp stickers. However, we hope to cater to the clean stuff. So let’s move further and add to the excitement of new Whatsapp sticker feature update by sharing list of active whatsapp groups where the best whatsapp stickers are circulated often.</p>
